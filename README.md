# TER
ISFA's TER work


The purpose of the neural network notebook is not to give our complete code. We want to make the reader want to read what we have done, so we have simplified the codes to give a glimpse of what the theory can do in practice. The trained neural network is however given as a linked file. If you want to know more about it or run it, don't hesitate to contact us!
